Wearable Computing
==================

The script in this repo will create two text files of data frame in your working directory when run. To check your working directory, execute in R studio the command line getwd().

The names of the files created are "dataset_1 - Training and Test.txt" and "dataset_2 - Average.txt". The first file contains the data frame which is the result of merging the training and test set. The second file corresponds to the independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

When running the script, and for each file browser opened, please browse to the location of the requested file and select it. As an example, on the screenshot below, the file X_train.txt is requested by the program to be selected. Depending on the size of the file and the performance of your machine, the file reading process may take some.
